						MuseHome is an innovative digital platform designed to transform the traditional museum experience through Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Developed as part of a web development module, this project creates an intelligent museum environment where physical spaces are enhanced through a variety of connected objects.
					</p>

					<p>
						The platform centralizes access to exhibitions, guided tours, interactive objects, and services related to security, ambiance, and energy consumption. It features a multi-tier user system with different access levels, from occasional visitors to administrators, with users progressing through a points-based advancement system.
